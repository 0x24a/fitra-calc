Fitted DX Rating Calculator for MaimaiDX via Diving-Fish Prober. (SDGB Only)

## What is this?

A simple calculator that helps you calculate your fitted DX rating in MaimaiDX (SDGB).

## Disclaimer

I'm not a fullstack dev. My frontend code looks like it was written by a caffeinated raccoon at 3 AM. Yeah, it's all crammed into one HTML file. But it works. Sometimes that's all that matters.

## How To Run

1. Download `index.html` or clone the repo
2. Host it anywhere:
   - open it directly in the browser
   - use `python -m http.server`, miniserve or anything else idk
   - deploy it to GitHub Pages, Netlify, wherever
   - just make it run

## Contributing

Edit `index.html` and open a pull request. This is a side project I made for fun, so I can't promise I'll merge everything.
